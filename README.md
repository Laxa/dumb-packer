# Dumb-packer

This packer is highly inspired by Gynvael's stream, a lot of the code is reused from his stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RK7sYTOeNk

This version is improved in some way:
* more strict error checking (although far from perfect)
* should be compatible with 32 and 64 bits
* dynamic binaries should work
